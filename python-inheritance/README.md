Python â€“ Inheritance

This project explores **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, with a focus on **inheritance**.

ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to clearly explainâ€”without using Google:

General

- Superclass / Baseclass / Parentclass**: Understand what a superclass is and how it provides common attributes and methods for its subclasses.  

- Subclass**: Define what a subclass is and how it inherits and extends the behavior of its superclass.  

- Listing Attributes & Methods**: Use tools like `dir()` to list all attributes and methods of a class or an instance.  

- Instance Attributes**: Identify when and how an instance can have new attributes beyond those defined in its class.  

- Class Inheritance**: Learn how to create a class that inherits from another using Pythonâ€™s inheritance syntax.  

- Multiple Inheritance**: Define a class that inherits from multiple base classes and understand the method resolution order (MRO).  

- Default Base Class**: Recognize that every Python class ultimately inherits from the built-in `object` class.  

- Overriding Methods & Attributes**: Override inherited methods or attributes to customize or extend behavior in subclasses.  

- Attributes & Methods by Heritage**: Know which attributes or methods are automatically available to subclasses through inheritance.  

- Purpose of Inheritance**: Explain why inheritance promotes code reuse, organization, and scalability.  

- Built-in Functions**: Use and understand `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `type()`, and `super()` for type checking and calling parent methods.
