# Python – Modules and Command Line Arguments

## Description
In this project, I explore **Python modules** and **command line arguments**, focusing on writing reusable code, importing functions, and controlling script execution. This project reinforces Python style guidelines and best practices for executable scripts.

By completing this project, I deepen my understanding of how Python programs are structured and how they interact with the command line environment.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I am able to explain the following concepts **without using Google**:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in `dir()` function
- How to prevent code in a script from executing when imported
- How to use command line arguments in Python programs

## Resources
I used the following resources:
- Python Modules
- Command line arguments
- Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code

Man or help:

## Requirements

### General
- I used only the following editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.10.\*)**
