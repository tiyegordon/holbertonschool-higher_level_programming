Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain the following concepts clearly—without relying on Google:

General

Why Python programming is awesome
I can describe the strengths of Python, such as its readability, versatility, and powerful ecosystem.

What sets are and how to use them
I understand what a set is in Python and how to create, modify, and access its elements.

The most common methods of sets and how to use them
I can confidently use methods such as add(), remove(), union(), intersection(), and others.

When to use sets versus lists
I can explain situations where sets are preferable (like ensuring uniqueness or performing set operations) compared to lists.

How to iterate through a set
I can write Python code to loop over elements in a set effectively.

What dictionaries are and how to use them
I understand the dictionary data structure, how to store key–value pairs, and how to access or update them.

When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
I can identify scenarios where dictionaries are the best choice for mapping keys to values compared to using lists or sets.

What a key is in a dictionary
I can explain what keys represent and how they are used to retrieve corresponding values.

How to iterate over a dictionary
I can loop through keys, values, or key–value pairs in a dictionary.

What a lambda function is
I can create anonymous functions using the lambda keyword and know when to use them.

What the map, reduce, and filter functions are
I can demonstrate how to apply these functional programming tools to transform, aggregate, or filter data.
