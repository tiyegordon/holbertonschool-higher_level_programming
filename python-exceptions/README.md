Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain and demonstrate the following concepts without relying on Google:

General

Why Python programming is awesome
I can describe what makes Python powerful and versatile—its readability, large standard library, and active community.

What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
I understand that errors are issues in the program (like syntax errors) that prevent code from running, while exceptions occur during execution and can be handled.

What exceptions are and how to use them
I can explain that exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program and show how to work with them in Python.

When we need to use exceptions
I know when to implement exception handling—for example, when dealing with unpredictable inputs, file operations, or external resources.

How to correctly handle an exception
I can use try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage exceptions safely.

The purpose of catching exceptions
I can articulate that catching exceptions prevents a program from crashing and allows for graceful error handling or fallback logic.

How to raise a built-in exception
I know how to use the raise keyword to trigger a specific built-in exception when certain conditions occur.

When to implement a clean-up action after an exception
I can explain when and how to use the finally block to perform clean-up tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.
