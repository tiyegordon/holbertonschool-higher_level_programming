# Python – More Classes and Objects

## Overview
This project expands on core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
It demonstrates how to design robust, reusable, and maintainable code using advanced features such as class attributes, special methods, and different types of methods.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, the following concepts are applied and demonstrated:

### General
- Why Python programming is a powerful and versatile language
- Principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- The concept of **“first-class everything”** in Python
- Definition and purpose of a **class**
- What an **object** is and how it differs from an **instance**
- The difference between a **class** and an **object/instance**
- Understanding and using **attributes**
- How to work with **public, protected, and private attributes**
- The meaning and role of **`self`**
- What a **method** is and how it operates within a class
- The purpose and usage of the special **`__init__` method**
- Concepts of **Data Abstraction**, **Data Encapsulation**, and **Information Hiding**
- What a **property** is and how it differs from an attribute
- The Pythonic way to write **getters and setters**
- Special methods **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`**: purpose and differences
- Difference between **object attributes** and **class attributes**
- Understanding and creating a **class method**
- Understanding and creating a **static method**
- How to **dynamically create new attributes** for existing instances
- How to **bind attributes** to objects and classes
- What the **`__dict__`** attribute of a class and an instance contains
- How Python **resolves attribute lookups** in objects and classes
- How to use the built-in **`getattr`** function
