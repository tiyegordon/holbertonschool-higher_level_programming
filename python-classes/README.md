# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Project Overview

## Background
This project demonstrates foundational concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**, highlighting the principles of classes, objects, encapsulation, and properties.

---

## Resources
Key materials referenced in developing this project:

- **Object-Oriented Programming** – Key sections:
  - General Introduction
  - First-class Everything
  - A Minimal Class in Python
  - Attributes (excluding class attributes)
  - Methods
  - The `__init__` Method
  - Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
  - Public, Protected, and Private Attributes
- **Properties vs. Getters and Setters**
- **Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming**
- **Python Classes and Objects**
- **Object Oriented Programming** (supplementary articles and videos)

## Learning Objectives
The project showcases the ability to clearly explain and implement the following:

### Core OOP Concepts
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is and why it is important
- The concept of “first-class everything”
- Definition and purpose of a class
- Difference between an object and an instance
- Attributes and their role in defining object state
- Public, protected, and private attributes and their usage
- The role of `self` within class methods
- Methods and their relationship to class behavior
- The special `__init__` method and its purpose
- Principles of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Properties and how they differ from attributes
- Pythonic approach to getters and setters
- Dynamically creating new attributes for existing instances
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- Understanding and using the `__dict__` of a class or instance
- How Python locates and resolves attributes of an object or class
- Usage of the built-in `getattr` function

---

## Technical Requirements
- All code executed on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with **Python 3.8.5**.
- Code conforms to **pycodestyle 2.7.\*** standards.
- Modules, classes, and functions include full Python documentation strings describing their purpose.
- Files are executable and end with a new line.
- Each source file begins with the shebang:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
